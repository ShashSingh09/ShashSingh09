# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shashank

I'm a passionate data science student with a strong foundation in MySQL, Pandas, Seaborn, and NumPy. My journey involves exploring and analyzing data to derive meaningful insights.

ðŸš€ **Skills:**
- **Languages:** Python, SQL
- **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Database Management:** MySQL
- **Machine Learning:**  Currently diving deep into supervised and unsupervised learning models.


ðŸŒ± **Currently Learning:**
- I'm currently sharpening my skills in machine learning, exploring various algorithms, and gaining hands-on experience with real-world datasets. The thrill of building predictive models and uncovering patterns in data keeps me motivated.

ðŸš€ **Most Liked: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- My favorite part of building models is the initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase. It's like solving a mystery, where each dataset has its own story to tell. Uncovering hidden patterns, detecting outliers, and understanding the underlying structure of the data is a fascinating process. EDA not only sets the foundation for a robust model but also allows me to form a deep connection with the data.


ðŸ‘¯ **I'm open to collaborations and discussions about:**
- Data Science
- Database Management
- Visualization Techniques
